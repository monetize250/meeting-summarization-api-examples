# Stop Wasting Time on Meeting Notes: Automate Summarization with One API

If you’ve ever stared at a wall of meeting text wondering how to extract the key points, you’re not alone. Keeping track of who said what and what actions were agreed upon is tedious, error‑prone and just plain boring. Fortunately, there’s now an easy way to automate the entire process.

## The Problem: Too Much Information, Too Little Time

Remote work has exploded the volume of recorded calls and transcripts. Teams use tools like Zoom, Google Meet and Microsoft Teams every day, generating hours of conversation. Translating those conversations into clear notes and actionable tasks is essential, yet many people still spend time manually summarising.

Manual note‑taking has downsides:

- **Important details get missed** when the note‑taker is multitasking.
- **Transcripts are long and repetitive**, making it hard to capture the essence of what was decided.
- **Action items can fall through the cracks**, leading to delayed follow‑ups and miscommunication.

Wouldn’t it be great if an API could do all of this for you?

## Meet the Meeting Summarization & Action Items API

I built a lightweight API that ingests plain‑text transcripts and returns two things:

1. **A concise summary** that captures the main discussion points using extractive techniques. You can control the length via a `ratio` or a `max_sentences` parameter.
2. **A checklist of action items** pulled directly from the transcript. The API looks for imperative verbs and phrases like “we should”, “we need” or “next step” to generate clear next steps.

No large language models or expensive third‑party dependencies are used, so it’s fast and inexpensive. You can access it via [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/your_username/api/meeting-summarization-api) with a generous free tier.

### How It Works

The API offers a single `POST /summarize` endpoint. Here’s a quick example in Python:

```python
import requests

url = "https://meeting-summarization-api.p.rapidapi.com/summarize"
payload = {
    "text": open("meeting_transcript.txt", "r").read(),
    "ratio": 0.25,  # summarise to 25% of original length
}
headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "X-RapidAPI-Key": "<YOUR_RAPIDAPI_KEY>",
    "X-RapidAPI-Host": "meeting-summarization-api.p.rapidapi.com"
}

response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
data = response.json()

print("Summary:", data["summary"])
print("Action Items:", data["action_items"])
```

You can also specify `max_sentences` instead of `ratio` if you need a fixed‑length summary:

```json
{
  "text": "...your transcript...",
  "max_sentences": 5
}
```

The API returns a JSON object like this:

```json
{
  "summary": "Key highlights from the meeting including project progress and timelines.",
  "action_items": [
    "Send revised proposal to the client by Friday.",
    "Organise design review meeting next Wednesday."
  ]
}
```

## Try the Demo Yourself

Want to see it in action without writing code? Check out the [Instant Meeting Summarizer demo](https://monetize250.github.io/instant-meeting-summarizer/). Paste your transcript, enter your RapidAPI key and click **Summarize**. The page will fetch the summary and action items directly from the API and display them instantly.

## Integrate with Your Tools

Here are a few ideas for how you can use the API:

- **Productivity apps:** Offer auto‑summarised meeting notes inside your project management tool or CRM.
- **Chatbots:** Send daily meeting summaries to Slack or Microsoft Teams channels.
- **Dashboards:** Visualise key themes and action items across multiple meetings.
- **Research assistants:** Quickly distil long interviews or focus groups into bullet‑point summaries.
